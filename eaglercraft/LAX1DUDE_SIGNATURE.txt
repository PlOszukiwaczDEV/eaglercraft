Hello, this is lax1dude, I regret to inform you that the official repository
for Eaglercraft 1.5.2 has been deleted

This folder contains a copy of the repo from the day it was deleted, and a tool
to verify it's authenticity

Run "GetRepositorySignature.bat", and verify that this is the result:


~~~ Repository SHA-256: ~~~

     ba2015db643a0dd6
     e78bbf92f27f76ae
     0797feb78874edb4
     19d14a8b54373269

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Additionally, verify that the following files have the following SHA-1 checksums:

GetRepositorySignature.jar: DCE2D7FDA9065B2475E5894E5D0960B57B03C661
GetRepositorySignature.bat: 4B995076348E03A5322F3EB6AF72948E4C27CEB6
GetRepositorySignature.sh: 8B269BA0D54C2B4BD7E9199B10C9769D39F00DC6


If this is all correct, then you are truly using the official final release of
Eaglercraft 1.5.2, made by the real LAX1DUDE ;>


You can download a clean copy of "GetRepositorySignature.jar" here: [https://deev.is/eagler/GetRepositorySignature.jar]

Use "GetRepositorySignature.sh" in place of "GetRepositorySignature.bat" on linux


run "java -jar GetRepositorySignature.jar" to launch a GUI version of the tool,
which allows you to select the repository to check using a file chooser

Thank you all for the stars and support for this project but I simply want closure
that I will never wake up one busy day in the future and have to drop everything
and come back to this project and fight a DMCA when I'm not even working on it
anymore. When a repository on github gets DMCA'd, all of it's forks also get DMCA'd
which would eradicate it off github, but if we all fork it and then delete the
original then Microsoft would have to DMCA individual forks instead of just my
original repository which they obviously don't have time to do. This is for the
best, trust me, we'll always have this checksum here of the files of the official
final release so we can always find a repo and come back to this commit and check
if it's mine and if it is then play it the way it was meant to be played with all
of my original code and it'll be like I never deleted it
